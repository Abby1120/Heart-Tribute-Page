        <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_(band)#Personnel" target="_blank"> Heart</a> is an American rock band that first found success in Canada and later in the United States and worldwide. Over the group's four-decade
        history, it has had three primary lineups, with the constant center of the group since 1973 being sisters Ann Wilson (lead singer) and Nancy Wilson (guitarist). Heart rose to fame in the mid-1970s with music influenced by hard rock and heavy metal,[1]
        as well as folk music. Their popularity declined in the early 1980s, but the band enjoyed a comeback starting in 1985 and experienced even greater success with album-oriented rock hits and hard-rock ballads into the 1990s.</p>

      <p>To date, Heart has sold over 35 million records worldwide,[2] including over 22.5 million in album sales in the U.S. They have had top 10 albums on the Billboard 200 in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2010s.[3] The group was ranked number 57 on VH1's
        "100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock". They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.[4][5]
      </p>

      <p>Heart has sold over 35 million records worldwide, had 20 Top 40 singles, seven Top 10 albums[98] and four Grammy nominations.[99] Heart achieved Top 10 albums on the Billboard charts in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2010s, with chart singles in each
        decade.[29] This span of over four decades gives them the longest span of Top 10 albums by a female fronted band.[100]</p>

      <p>One of Heart's defining characteristics is their diversity in music styles which has been evident in their chart successes.[original research?] The band has had singles on Billboard's Hot 100, Mainstream Rock Tracks, and Adult Contemporary charts.[101]
        Throughout their history, Heart has been labeled[by whom?] as Hard Rock, Folk, Easy Listening, Heavy Metal, and Adult Contemporary,[citation needed] many times demonstrating two or more of these styles on the same album. Their album title Dog
        and Butterfly was a symbol of their sometimes contradictory styles, with the "Dog" side of the album focusing on rock tunes and the "Butterfly" side made up of ballads. Their epic "Mistral Wind" from this album captured both styles in one song,
        starting as a mellow acoustic ballad and building to a metal crescendo.[102][103]</p>
